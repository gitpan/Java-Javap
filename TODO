Fix role/class naming so java dots become perl double colons.

x move generate method to named params so we can pass the other
  command line flags.

x standard type conversions
    int -> Int
    java.lang.String -> Str
    etc.

x multis

x parameter types for method declarations

document all modules with POD

allow command line supply of type casts?

x actually pass command line flags to emit

x handle class generation (is it the same as interfaces?)
    essentially like interfaces, but using class definitions constructors
    are skipped as the only normal purpose of sub method BUILD is to
    convert positional parameters to named parameters which Perl constructors
    expect.  Implementing that would require detailed knowledge of the
    internals of the Java classes, which would defeat most of the purpose
    of an abstraction layer.

Implement command line options:
    nest
    outdir
    recurse

Make output go to a file in the current directory named for the role
or class by default (in Std generator).  Tell all generators about
nest and outdir.

Write generators which dump the ast with Data::Dumper and YAML.

handle thrown errors

handle class constants (requires loading the java class or interface)
